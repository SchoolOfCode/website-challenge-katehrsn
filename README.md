# Website Challenge

For my first project, I had to develop my HTML and CSS skills to create a 1 page website all about my partner (or 'client') that represents them to them to the rest of the cohort.

In order to ensure I would be able to manage my time effectively, I made a plan and divided the task into three stages: **research**; **design**; and **development**:

## Research

I decided to start by getting to know my client, Alina, over a zoom call - where we chatted about all sorts of things. This helped me to get an idea of what is important to her and what kind of things I should include on her website so that I can create something that really reflects who she is

I then used *Pinterest* and *Coolors* to source some layout and colour scheme examples and added them to a [survey](https://forms.gle/7TPu7MrupJYyqjkE9) I asked Alina to complete, to help me get a rough idea of what she would like the website to look like. Looking back, I would have liked to have added more design elements to the survey, eg. fonts, stock images, icon styles, etc. but the survey did give me a really good jumping off point for the rest of my research.

Using what I learned from Alina's responses to the layout examples, I created 6 basic wireframes of potential layouts and added them to a [survey](https://forms.gle/qFqZgGjMtDVrWGsS7) I sent to my group in order to get an idea of what users would like to see. On reflection, it may have been more helpful to use a larger sample size, as my group was just 4 women so the insights I gained from their responses did not necessarily reflect the views of all users in the cohort.

Finally, I created another [survey](https://forms.gle/2ve6v2QWQSBBNhhY8) for Alina, in order to gain a more solid idea of what content I should include on the website: asking if the focus should be more personal or professional, visual or informational, as well as asking her to write about herself and upload some photos. This all gave me a really solid idea of what I should be working towards before I started designing.

## Design

Using everything I learned through my research I began writing the copy for the website, making sure to check in and share with Alina and get her input and approval as I went. I decided to present the information in shorter paragraphs and sentences as this was what the majority of responses from my wireframe survey wanted. I also tried to keep the tone light-hearted to reflect Alina as person, and my planned design of the website.

Then, I started making graphics for the website, using Adobe software and Canva to edit photos sent to me by Alina. In the first survey I sent, Alina's favourite layouts both had a collage type design with doodles, so I tried to recreate this in my design. Once, I had a fairly solid idea of all the visual elements and information I would be using, I created a mockup on Illustrator.![mockup](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3e6oXHrp1ciOPKwHcKDoRtiXs8hrV7flkaxaycdkXQcKggpmNW4kftpwFBr8o9lohYn4theIAoABSqQleghXlHQ71kbZgK-79BIO-2LuPPXdn-Epq7k96FsQdBW4lXLArRK3KSmbMzWj5IoJbsCbaQ=w441-h1249-no?authuser=0)

Ideally, I would have liked to create more than one mockup, however due to the short timeframe I had to complete the website, I didn't think it would be an effective use of my time. I checked in with Alina and got her to sign off on the final design of the website before I began writing the code.

## Development

Before I started actually adding text and images, I decided to get the layout sorted. So, I created all the basic structure in HTML and then added 5 divs to the main element of the body. I then styled these divs in CSS so they would each take up the full size of the screen and gave them each a background colour. I then created the navigation bar, styled it, and made sure everything worked.

From there, there I had no real method - there was a lot of trial and error to get the images and text to line up on the page just how I wanted. I tried to problem solve myself and googled everything I didn't know. I ended up redesigning some of the graphics so that they would fit better alongside the text and give a more cohesive design to the website.

Once I had everything added and styled so that the website looked how I wanted, I tried to go through and tidy up the code - I wanted to get rid of any repeat lines in CSS on individual elements and move them to the corresponding classes, however, this ended up not working and moving everything on the website around. If I had more time this is something I would have liked to have fixed and improve on, but as I didn't I decided to leave it be as I didn't think my code was too messy as I had tried to keep everything as simple as possible.

Overall, I'm proud of what I've created as my client really likes the website - I hope you do too! :)
